The team who developed Indaba support a limited training environment hosted online. This can be used to engage in remote training of Indaba facilitators without having an Indaba Kit present.

## Trainer Site Access

Access to run training using the site is by invitation only. Your Google enabled account will be added and you will then be able to login via [https://app.indaba.dev](https://app.indaba.dev). The training experience is very similar to that of the Indaba Kit Dashboard, with the following limitations:

- No backup/restore options are available.
- All content is removed after 48 hours.
- A different (almost identical) Android application is required to access the training environment.

## Trainee Access

If trainees with to engage in with the process themselves during the training they can download the following Android application:

<!-- - Download and manually install onto your device from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/our-story-media/ourstory-android/releases/latest/download/dev.indaba.apk).
-->

<DownloadLink type="primary" url="https://github.com/our-story-media/ourstory-android/releases/latest/download/dev.indaba.apk" />

<Tip>

You will be prompted to enable Unknown Sources when installing this application, this is normal for applications not from the Google Play Store and is OK to accept in this instance.
