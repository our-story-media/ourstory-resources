# Quick Start

<Leader>

It's highly recommended to read the [Guide](/guide/), but if you are happy with the Indaba process then go ahead and follow the instructions below to get started.

## Training

<Leader>

We provide a transient training environment to enable training of staff with Indaba without having a Dashboard Kit available.

## Android Application

Every Indaba deployment requires devices with the Android Application installed. It's in the Play Store, and also as a download if you are using Titan.

## Setup a Shoot

<Leader>

Each deployment in Indaba (video activity group of participants) is represented as a `Shoot`. Through a Shoot you mange what should be captured, how to tag the content and Who and when the process can be used. Shoots are managed through the Dashboard.
