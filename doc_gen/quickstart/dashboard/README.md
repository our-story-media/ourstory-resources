# Dashboard

<Leader>

The Dashboard is where you configure all settings, workflows and content with regards to Indaba. Only `Shoot Administrators` have access to the Dashboard.

</Leader>

## Getting Started

Visit the Dashboard via a browser, and `Start New Shoot`. The Dashboard can be accessed at [http://indaba.local](http://indaba.local) or [http://10.10.10.1](http://10.10.10.1) once you are connected to the `INDABA` WiFi network, using the password available within the Indaba Kit. Keep this password secure, to avoid participants having access to the Dashboard and all content for a Shoot.

1. Create a new shoot for your deployment.
2. The default settings should be OK for most deployments, but please check before entering the field.
3. Upload context appropriate images for each `Theme` in the `Template` screen.

## Optional Configuration

There are a number of elements that can to be configured **before** entering a deployment:

### Tags

Tags are the labels participants use to select and aggregate videos into stories. The name, color and language of these tags can be adjusted to align with your specific use case. The default configuration includes tags based on the OECD DAC criteria for Monitoring and Evaluation.

### Template

To align better with your deployment context you can adjust the `Template` - the set of suggested shots and descriptions for participants. There are infinite options for creating these templates, or you can use one of the existing ones in Indaba. We also provide a large archive of shot suggestions to build your own.

### Brand Image

A pre-prepared image can be added to all published videos produced by Indaba. Make sure you create and verify this image before entering the field to avoid connectivity issues.
