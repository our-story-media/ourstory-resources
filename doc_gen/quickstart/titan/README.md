## Installation Guide

Once downloaded, you should not require internet connectivity, if you have both the above files.

> At some points during this installation you may be asked to input your Administration credentials for the Local Machine. Please do not skip any of these steps, as they are vital parts of the installation.

When opening the installer, please read the introduction text and agree. Then click Install.

As this is the first time running Our Story, it will take a bit of time to setup all the components. Please wait and do not close or turn off your computer while this process is happening. On some computers this may take up to 15 minutes.

Once this initial step has completed, you are presented with a check. At this point you need to connect your computer to the Our Story WiFi network you have prepared, with an IP range of `10.10.10.*`. Our Story will attempt to autoconfigure your computer to match these settings.

> You can continue without an Our Story router, however some images and functions may not work as expected.
