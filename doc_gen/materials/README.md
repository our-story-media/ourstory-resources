# Materials

<Leader>

To deploy Indaba in the field, you will require a variety of physical materials. Below are ready-to-download versions which you can print yourself.


Some of these documents are provided as templates so that you can adjust to your own context, or in some circumstances you might want to adjust existing resources, in situations such as:

- Translation of content into a new language
- Refinement of tags used to match your workflow

## Example Consent Form

Consent forms need to be adjusted to any specific deployment. Never just use these without first adjusting them you both your requirements and your community. Do be aware of both the communities literacy level, and the need to clearly explain your consent procedure verbally as well as through a consent form.

There is often a difference between a `media release` and a `research consent` form, as these might cover different parts of the media generated by the community. You may need a combination of the two.

## Stickers

Stickers are used to link together paper based activities with digital processes to aid understanding and transparency in the process.

They can be printed on standard layout printer label sheets for easy use.
