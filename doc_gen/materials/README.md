# Materials

<Banner>

In response to current worldwide changes in working practices, we are currently working on updated resources for socially and physically distanced field deployments.

</Banner>

<Leader>

To deploy Indaba in the field, you will require a variety of physical materials. Below are ready-to-download versions which you can print yourself.


Some of these documents are provided as templates so that you can adjust to your own context, or in some circumstances you might want to adjust existing resources, in situations such as:

- Translation of content into a new language
- Refinement of tags used to match your workflow

</Leader>

## <New /> Socially Distanced Deployments

We have produced an additional guide which you can use to help you plan and facilitate the Indaba process in situations that are socially/physically distanced.

<translated-dropdown title="Social Distancing Guide (PDF)" :langs="['en','es']" link="https://github.com/our-story-media/ourstory-resources/raw/master/field-materials/facilitator-guide-distance/print-yourself/distance-guide-selfprint-%%.pdf" />

<DownloadLink  url="https://github.com/our-story-media/ourstory-resources/tree/master/field-materials/facilitator-guide-distance/print-professional">Socially Distanced Guide (Professional Print Files)</DownloadLink>

*Full bleed print versions and InDesign Files available. Translations coming early 2020.*

## Training Manual

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have developed the following training manual which explains the Indaba process, the various contexts where it has been carried out, its different phases, and the tools and resources needed to run an Indaba participatory video initiative for monitoring and evaluation and/or other contexts.

## Example Consent Form

Consent forms need to be adjusted to any specific deployment. Never just use these without first adjusting them you both your requirements and your community. Do be aware of both the communities literacy level, and the need to clearly explain your consent procedure verbally as well as through a consent form.

There is often a difference between a `media release` and a `research consent` form, as these might cover different parts of the media generated by the community. You may need a combination of the two.

## Stickers

Stickers are used to link together paper based activities with digital processes to aid understanding and transparency in the process.

They can be printed on standard layout printer label sheets for easy use.

## Pocket Guide

The pocket guide is a pocket-size booklet designed to be given to volunteers in the field to aid them in the process. Each page in the guide responds to a step in the process, and includes simple reminders on key elements and activities that need to be performed.
