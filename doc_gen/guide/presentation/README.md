# Community Feedback

<Leader>

Key to the Our Story process is presentation of the produced stories back to the wider community. Often this is accompanied with a meal or other communal gathering.

::: tip Outcome of Step

Each video should have been presented back to the community in a presentation setting. Final versions of each video should be available to leave with the community on a USB stick or drive.

## Playing Videos

<Materials>

- Projector or TV
- Means of amplifying audio (speakers)

</Materials>

The easiest (and most time efficient) method of playing videos to the community is to connect one of the Android devices to a TV or projector directly, and then play each video directly from the Stories Timeline screen.

The following steps demonstrate this:

1. Make sure the Dashboard is running and available to your device.
1. Select one of the Android devices to use for your presentation. Take note of which Group is logged in.
1. For each Story in the Dashboard that you want to present select the `Clone` option, and then with the clone, select the `Reassign to User` option and reassign to the above group.
1. Connect the Android device to your projector or screen.
1. Open the Story you want to present in the Editor on the first Android device.
1. Press the `Fullscreen` button in the top-right, and then select `Play`.
1. Repeat for each Story that requires presentation.

## Exporting Videos

<Materials>

- 2 USB Drives

</Materials>

Each of the Stories produced by the community should be left with them before leaving the field.

All content produced during the process is stored on the computer running the Our Story Dashboard. To obtain these files, the easiest method is to locate the Story in the Dashboard and select the `Download` option via the options menu.

::: tip
We recommend that you handover files safely to local community representatives so they can determine the most appropriate way to share the videos with interested parties. We have previously done this by using USB flash drives that we take with us to the field.
