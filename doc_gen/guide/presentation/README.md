# Community Feedback

<Leader>

Key to the Indaba process is presentation of the produced stories back to the wider community. Often this is accompanied with a meal or other communal gathering.

</Leader>

<Tip title="Outcome of Step">

Each video should have been presented back to the community in a presentation setting. Final versions of each video should be available to leave with the community on a USB stick or drive.

## Playing Videos

</TimeGuide>

<Materials title="Materials">

- Projector or TV
- Means of amplifying audio (speakers)

</Materials>

<App />
<Dashboard />

The easiest (and most time efficient) method of playing videos to the community is to connect one of the Android devices to a TV or projector directly, and then play each video directly from the Stories Timeline screen.

<AdminRole title="Facilitator Action: Present Videos">

1. Make sure the Dashboard is running and available to your device.
1. Select one of the Android devices to use for your presentation. Take note of which Group is logged in.
1. For each Story in the Dashboard that you want to present select the `Clone` option, and then with the clone, select the `Reassign to User` option and reassign to the above group.
1. Connect the Android device to your projector or screen.
1. Open the Story you want to present in the Editor on the first Android device.
1. Press the `Fullscreen` button in the top-right, and then select `Play`.
1. Repeat for each Story that requires presentation.

## Publishing

<App />
<Dashboard />

Before you leave the field it is important to `Publish` each story, allowing you to leave the final version of each with the community. The process of turning individual videos selected by them in the Creation process into a single video file is called `Publishing`.

<AdminRole title="Facilitator Action: Publishing Stories">

Editing and producing the final story files takes a lot of CPU power and battery (when using Titan), hence we recommend that administrators disable publishing using the Dashboard until all the groups have finished creating their stories to prevent unnecessary resource use. You can re-enable publishing once you are sure that no more groups are working on their videos or you are at the end of the story creation stage for all the groups. This is done via the `Dashboard` option `Enable Publishing`.

Usually by this point you have already copied each final story into a single user account so that you can access them all on one mobile device. IF this is not yet the case, follow the steps above.

Open each story in the App and select `Publish Now`. This will add the story to a queue for processing by the Dashboard.

**WARNING: THIS PROCESS IS VERY TIME CONSUMING AND WILL REQUIRE YOUR LAPTOP TO BE PLUGGED INTO MAINS POWER**

Stories will continue to process without the Android device being available.

## Exporting Videos

</TimeGuide>

<Materials title="Materials">

- 2 USB Drives

</Materials>

<Dashboard />

Each of the Stories produced by the community should be left with them before leaving the field.

All content produced during the process is stored on the computer running the Indaba Dashboard. To obtain these files, the easiest method is to locate the Story in the Dashboard and select the `Download` option via the options menu.

<Tip>

We recommend that you handover files safely to local community representatives so they can determine the most appropriate way to share the videos with interested parties. We have previously done this by using USB flash drives that we take with us to the field.
