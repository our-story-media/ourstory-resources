## Getting the Videos

**Titan**

All content produced during the process is stored on the computer running the Our Story application.

These files are stored as mp4 video files in the `./upload` folder. Lower resolution files are stored within the `upload/transcode/upload` folder.

**Online**

Download videos from the Dashboard using the options button on the Story.
