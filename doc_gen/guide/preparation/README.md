# Preparation

<Leader>

Before deploying to a community, you need to consider how the Our Story process will work within the specific context, and work with the community or other organisations to understand the expectations and process goals.

</Leader>

::: tip Outcome of Step

You should have a clear plan for working with the community, have setup and tested your deployment technology, identified how to group the target community and prepared 

:::

<TimeGuide time="Up to 6 months prior">Planning and Buy-in Process</TimeGuide>

As Our Story is a community-led approach, it is first important to ensure there is buy-in from the community, project/programme stakeholders, country/regional/HQ offices for the initiative before initiating onsite and offsite planning.

Offsite Planning: This would consist of all the things the team should plan before arriving on location, equipment (Android devices), facilitation materials, local participating teams for capacity building and sustainability of the approach, volunteers needed, interpreters, transportation needed for the team and for transporting community groups to filming locations (should it be needed), etc.

Onsite Planning: Introduction meetings with the local organisation; community leaders and at times government representatives.

## Community Selection

As this is an initiative which requires the presence of community representatives on a daily basis, it is recommended that the agreement of the selected community to the initiative be secured prior to arrival of the team to the field. The target groups you will work with will depend upon your project/programme and the sampling process used to best ensure representation and the feedback needs of your initiative.

Therefore in this initiative, you would:

Identify a community that is a recipient of the project/programme using a fair and unbiased approach. 
Select the target groups which are most relevant for feedback to the project/programme in a fair and unbiased manner. The number of available Android devices (Tablets) in the project/programme may also limit the number/size of groups which can be formed. 

<StepOptions title="Community Selection Method">

> Sampling methods: To limit biais we would recommend that probability sampling methods be used. For the Our Story process, stratified sampling has been frequently used, whereby the facilitator has divided the entire community into specific groups and then individuals have self-selected themselves from the group on a voluntary basis. 

> As it is important for the selected group to be able to work together on 1 Android device (tablet), if the number of self-selected community members is too large, the stratified sampling method can be used with other sampling approaches to reach the objective of the Our Story initiative.

> Other types of tools/documents which can help facilitate the selection of the community and/or target groups:
Vulnerability Capacity Assessment: Community-led assessment which measures people exposure to and capacity to resist natural hazards. It is complementary to national and sub-national risk, hazard, vulnerability and capacity mapping exercises and can be used to identify communities most-at-risk. Go to: http://vcarepository.info/

> Online Sample Calculators: There are numerous type of online sampling calculators which can be used, such as: https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm or www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html. There are also  excel versions of sample calculators.

The Our Story process does not reply on communities communicating in a particular language, however you may wish to translate written materials into a relevant local language or dialect. See the Internationalization guide for more information.

## Ethical considerations  - Do No Harm



As per the 

**How do I consent participants?**

Click here for a standard consent script that we use when we have done deployments previously. Not that this is a script: you will need to customise this to your preferences in conversation with local NGO partners (if appropriate). You can use this consent script to inform your debrief with the community at the start. It is essential that adults and minors are consented properly, taking into account local laws that legislate this matter. 



Participants need to be informed about how their data will be used, that their participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw at any time without giving reasons. 

**Does Our Story share my details?**

No, Our Story is provided as is, without warranty and does not share any details with third parties. 

We collect anonymised statistics about the Our Story: Online platformâ€™s use. 

**Do I give out devices to the participants?**

We recommend that you assign one tablet/phone per sub-group within the set of participants you are working with e.g. one device each for men, women, youth, elderly etc. 

The group is encouraged to work together and share access to the tablet to capture and review footage. We recommend that you label each device (using writeable plaster tape) with the name of the group (e.g. men) and on the first day before handing the device to the group to sign-in with the name of the group on the sign-in screen of the app. More instructions on how to join a project and sign-in are provided here. 

After the groups have been trained on using basic features of the app, they can be given the device for the Capture, Review and Editing stage. Be aware of where the devices are at all times and be sure to collect the devices at the end of each day to backup the data.
