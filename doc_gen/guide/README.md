# What is Our Story?

<Leader>

Our Story is a process to support collaborative film-making by non-professionals. It supports the entire process from commissioning content, helping contributors capture high value content, to creating edits \(stories\) representing their narratives.

</Leader>

Our Story is an innovative approach to supporting local communities share their stories using video. Traditionally,  video production has been seen as a highly skilled endeavour and was limited to those with high media literacy. Using Our Story, a group/community/organisation can collaboratively shoot, edit and publish videos.



## The Process

The {{$ourstory}} process consists of a set of activities that you can deploy over short period of time.

::: tip
<i class="el-icon-right large" /> The input to the process is flexible, but is at the level of criteria to which the community should be responding with content. Examples include **a monitoring excercise**, **an ideation process** or **an ethnographic study**.
:::

::: tip
<i class="el-icon-back large" /> The output of the process is a set of curated videos from representitive groups within the community. These videos are tagged with labels related to the input criteria.

## Three Tools

The Our Story process is supported by three key elements:

### Workflow and Paper-Based Materials

TODO


### Android Mobile Application

The Our Story app helps you participate in film shoots. Just download the app and follow the instructions to get involved. Upload footage using WiFi when you're done.

### Management Dashboard

The Our Story website lets you organise and plan a film shoot. Easy to use settings allow you to tailor it to your needs, and then get participants involved.

Our Story acts like your personal director. You can control what shots, how many, location and subject. This flexible structure supports any kind of shoot scenario.

## Technology Considerations

::: tip
Although advanced computer skills are not a requirement, some knowledge of using computers and software will be useful during the setup process.
:::

Our Story consists of an application running on a computer \(laptop\) which is present at the deployment location, alongside an Android application running on mobile devices which at various points communicate with the local computer over WiFi.

No upstream \(internet\) is required at the deployment location, and if appropriate batteries and power management is used, Our Story can be deployed in remote locations without power or connectivity.
