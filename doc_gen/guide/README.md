# What is Our Story?

<Leader>

Our Story is an innovative approach to supporting local communities share their stories using video. Traditionally,  video production has been seen as a highly skilled endeavour and was limited to those with high media literacy. Using Our Story, a group/community/organisation can collaboratively shoot, edit and publish videos. 

<!-- Our Story is a process to support collaborative film-making by non-professionals. It supports the entire process from commissioning content, helping contributors capture high value content, to creating edits \(stories\) representing their narratives. -->

Our Story uses innovative features within a digitally augmented process to allow non-professionals to support community delivered media. The Our Story process works very much like a 5 day 'film school'. It takes a community through the key stages of making a video to tell their stroy, from ideation to production, allowing them to perform all steps along the way without content intervention by the Facilitator.

Our Story has been developed through a long-term partnership between Newcastle University (UK), Monash University (Australia) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Cresent Societies (Geneva).

The process has been developed itterativly through real deployments in field settings across the world. See our [Publications and Press](/guide/pubs/) section for related reading.

<el-divider content-position="left"><i class="el-icon-trophy"/> Core Values</el-divider>

Our Story was developed within a set of core values and design principles:

- To empower the use of video as a means to support **community voice**.
- To support **sustainable and practical** use of video with communities in field contexts.
- To be **Open Source**, and Creative Commons in everything we do so that knowledge is shared.

## Our Story in Practice

**Indonesia (in collaboration with Palang Merah Indonesia):** A participatory video monitoring initiative looking at community feedback on a  water, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH) project in East Kalimantan region, Indonesia.

**Namibia (in collaboration with Namibia Red Cross Society):** A participatory video monitoring initiative looking at community feedback on a Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC)  project in Grootfontein region, Namibia.

**Egypt (in collaboration with Egyptian Red Crescent Society):**  A participatory video baseline initiative looking at community feedback to contribute to the planning phase of ERC’s School Children Training Programme “Health and Safety”in a deaf school in Helwan, Egypt.

## The Process

The {{$ourstory}} process consists of a set of activities that you can deploy over short period of time.

::: tip
<i class="el-icon-bottom large" /> The input to the process is flexible, but is at the level of criteria to which the community should be responding with content. Examples include **a monitoring excercise**, **an ideation process** or **an ethnographic study**.

<el-timeline>
<el-timeline-item timestamp="Day 1" placement="top">

<h4>Ideation & Planning</h4>
<p>The community selects representitive groups, working through a set of design tasks to develop structured narrative ideas for videos.</p>

</el-timeline-item>
<el-timeline-item timestamp="Day 2-3" placement="top">

<h4>Capture & Review</h4>
<p>Each group uses the Android application to capture their own videos, adding labels to match them against their plan.</p>

</el-timeline-item>
<el-timeline-item timestamp="Day 4" placement="top">

<h4>Creation</h4>
<p>Each group uses tagged videos to produce a Story (edit) which includes titles and music.</p>

</el-timeline-item>
<el-timeline-item timestamp="Day 5" placement="top">

<h4>Community Feedback</h4>
<p>Each of the videos produced by the groups is played back to the community, and copies of the content are left with community representitives.</p>

</el-timeline-item>
</el-timeline>

::: tip
<i class="el-icon-bottom large" /> The output of the process is a set of curated videos from representitive groups within the community. These videos are tagged with labels related to the input criteria.

## Three Tools

The Our Story process is supported by three parts:

### 1. Workflow and Paper-Based Materials

Our Story is responsive and configurable to your specific community context. We provide key paper-based materials to help facilitate key processes such as Ideation and Taggin which can be used or adjusted as required.

### 2. Android Mobile Application

The Our Story App enables participants to directly contribute to the film making process. This application is provided on Android devices to the community during the deployment to record, tag and edit videos.

### 3. Management Dashboard

The Our Story website lets you organise and plan a film shoot. Easy to use settings allow you to tailor it to your needs, and then get participants involved. Our Story acts like your personal director. You can control what shots, how many, location and subject. This flexible structure supports any kind of shoot scenario.

## Technology Considerations

::: tip
Although advanced computer skills are not a requirement, some knowledge of using computers and software will be useful during the setup process.
:::

Our Story consists of an application running on a computer \(laptop\) which is present at the deployment location, alongside an Android application running on mobile devices which at various points communicate with the local computer over WiFi.

No upstream \(internet\) is required at the deployment location, and if appropriate batteries and power management is used, Our Story can be deployed in remote locations without power or connectivity.
