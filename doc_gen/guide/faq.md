# Frequently Asked Questions

## **What is Our Story?**

Our Story is an integrated solution for helping people make videos together using mobile devices. 

## How does it work?

Our Story organises film shoots using collections of shots organised by genre called templates. For instance: a live music video might contain wide shots of the band, closeups of the musicians and detail shots of their instruments.

## How many people can share an Our Story shoot?

As many as you like! The only limit to the size of Our Story projects is your imagination.

## Does Our Story share my details with anyone?

Our Story does not share any information without your permission. The shoot administrators can choose how they want to distribute share the created videos and footage with others. 

## What can I do with Our Story videos once they're uploaded?
Our Story’s mobile app lets you make basic edits of footage from your shoot. Alternatively, you can load your footage into editing software such as Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere and let Our Story’s EDL exporter take the work out of logging clips.

## Does Our Story need a good 3G/4G signal?
Our Story: Online shoots can run without 3G after you’ve initially joined the shoot on the app. Of course, the offline version does not require any internet connection in the first place. 

## How big are Our Story video files?
Our Story uses your mobile device’s camera at the best settings it can find, so file size can vary. When using Our Story it’s a good idea to make sure you have plenty of free space on your mobile device and only upload footage over WiFi.

It is also important to have some free space on the laptop you will be using to make sure that all participant videos can be safely uploaded to that device. We recommend that before each deployment you safely move any personal media or large files/folders from your laptop to an external hard drive to ensure that there is enough free space on the laptop for running an Our Story deployment.
