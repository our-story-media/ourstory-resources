# Ideation

NEEDS MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT HOW TO ACTUALLY RUN THIS PROCESS!!!

<Leader>

The ideation step in the process is designed to introduce the community to the Our Story process, and to support them creating their stories that they will then record onto video later in the process.

</Leader>

::: tip Outcome of Step

Each group in the community you are working with should have a flipchart sheet with 2-3 stories they want to tell, tagged in terms of key labels which relate to your aims.

<TimeGuide time="1 hour">Familiarisation</TimeGuide> 

<Materials>

Prompt materials (photos) to help the community contextualise what you are asking of them.

</Materials>


Working with the whole community, we provide them with prompts about the issues they are talking about (e.g. photos from the project they are providing feedback for). Using the flipchart paper, a scribe writes down the views of the community.

The community are organized into pre-organised groups (e.g. Men, Women, Youth, Elderly)

**Story-cards**


They are given cards which help them think about key questions to answer for the project and then. They write down the responses to the cards on flipchart paper.

<Materials>

- Flipchart
- Pens
- Tag Stickers

</Materials>


In each group, based on the flipchart paper from the previous activity, they write down 2 or 3 stories that they want to tell.

We use the following questions to structure this discussion:


* Who: who is the issue about or affecting? 

* What: what is the issue? 

* Where: where is this happening? 

* When: the timeline for this issue.. 

* Recommendation: what is your recommendation going forward?

<!-- ## Preparing Hands-on materials 

In previous deployments, we have found that using paper materials helps us engage the communities to think about their stories more effectively. This way even before they are using the app to capture their videos, they are thinking about their stories and experiences.

## How to use the paper materials? 

Look at the methodology section for an example use of the materials as the Our Story team have previously used them. You are advised to do at least one deployment drawing on this methodology before you create your own process, to ensure that you walk through the process properly once. 

## Story Cards

These are colour coordinated cards (A7 size) that contain key questions for each sector/theme  that the project organisers want the community to think about as they brainstorm for the video content. We suggest that you keep a maximum limit of  3 or 4 sectors and 5 questions per sector, to prevent the groups from being overwhelmed with questions. 

These sectors will also be used as tags for the videos produced so it is important to use the same wording and colours for the story cards and the video tags for consistency. 

## Labels (Stickers)

(Optional) Additionally, you might find it beneficial to print some stickers that contain the names of the sectors. These can then be used to stick to the flipchart paper that each group is producing.  -->
