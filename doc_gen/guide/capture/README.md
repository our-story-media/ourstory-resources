# Capture

<Leader>

This step is where the community uses the materials developed in Step 1 to capture and tag videos using a mobile device. Capture and Review should be facilitated in a repeating fashion, where groups capture some content, then review theirs (and other groups' content) before repeating the cycle.

DIAGRAM - CAPTURE / REVIEW

In typical scenarios where each group will perform the Capture/Review step twice, they are encouraged to spend a short amount of time **Reviewing** content on the tablet device before going to capture more content.

::: tip Outcome of Step

Each group should have a set of individual videos which have been tagged.

## Joining the Shoot

*Initial Device Connection*

If the application is running on the computer, and all devices connected to the WiFi you can open the application on each Android Device.

On the first run, the application will search for a local application running on a computer, this may take up to 30 seconds.

This initial step needs to take place with your participants in range of the WiFi:

1. Get each group to select the shoot you want them to participate in.

2. Allow them to login, select a camera and open the camera screen.

As soon as a device has joined the camera screen and has downloaded the necessary assets, participants are able to contribute content without connection to the WiFi.

## Capturing Content

This process can be accomplished offline, i.e. the computer and WiFi connection does not have to be available.

<AdminRole title="Facilitator Task - Uploading Content">

It is important to build in time into the process to allow content to upload from tablets to the Dashboard.

Even when using Titan, this process can take time (> 2 mins per video), so it is often best to start this process in the field if possible, allowing the most content to be available to participants when they want to **Review** or **Create Stories**.
