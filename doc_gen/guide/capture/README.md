# Capture and Review

<Leader>

This step is where the community uses the materials developed in Step 1 to capture and tag videos using a mobile device. Capture and Review should be facilitated in a repeating fashion, where groups capture some content, then review theirs (and other groups' content) before repeating the cycle.

DIAGRAM - CAPTURE / REVIEW

In typical scenarios where each group will perform the Capture/Review step twice, they are encouraged to spend a short amount of time **Reviewing** content on the tablet device before going to capture more content.

::: tip Outcome of Step

Each group should have a set of individual videos which have been tagged.

### Community On-Boarding (once)

We recommend that you (either in individual groups, or as a community) walk participants through the basic steps of capturing content on an Android device. This might include example 'interviews' between pairs, or stand up demonstrations using volunteers to show how to connect microphones, hold devices and avoid typical video pitfalls.

<AdminRole title="Run the Dashboard">

If using Titan Edition, make sure the Dashboard is running and WiFi is running and connected before attempting to `Join` a device to a shoot. If using Online Edition, this will require Internet connectivity.

### Group On-Boarding (once)

This on-boarding process is only required once per group, per deployment unless devices are moved between groups.

1. Make sure each group has an Android device and any additional equipment (microphone etc.).
1. Connect the device to the WiFi or Internet service and open the Our Story application.
1. On the first run, the App will search for the Dashboard, this may take up to 30 seconds.
1. Get the group to select the shoot you want them to participate in.
1. Let the group login, select a Theme and open the camera screen.

As soon as a device has joined the camera screen and has downloaded the necessary assets, participants are able to contribute content without any WiFi or Internet connection.

### Recording Video

Each group is now given the opportunity to capture the videos described in the paper plan. Often these groups will travel across their locale, interview other members of their group or members of the community. As much effort as possible should be made to support them in doing these things without controlling their access to potential content.

### Joining the Shoot

*Initial Device Connection*

If the application is running on the computer, and all devices connected to the WiFi you can open the application on each Android Device.

On the first run, the application will search for a local application running on a computer, this may take up to 30 seconds.

This initial step needs to take place with your participants in range of the WiFi:

1. Get each group to select the shoot you want them to participate in.

2. Allow them to login, select a camera and open the camera screen.

As soon as a device has joined the camera screen and has downloaded the necessary assets, participants are able to contribute content without connection to the WiFi.

### Capturing Content

This process can be accomplished offline, i.e. the computer and WiFi connection does not have to be available.

<AdminRole title="Facilitator Task - Uploading Content">

It is important to build in time into the process to allow content to upload from tablets to the Dashboard.

Even when using Titan, this process can take time (> 2 mins per video), so it is often best to start this process in the field if possible, allowing the most content to be available to participants when they want to **Review** or **Create Stories**.
