# Preparation

<Leader>

Our Story consists of 5 distinct steps. These steps are described in detail in the following sections. However before you enter a deployment, you might need to consider the following things.

</Leader> 

## Context

Our Story has been tested  in a number of different locations and for different project/programme initiatives (participatory baseline, monitoring and evaluation), some highlighted in the previous section. When using Our Story for a project/programme, consider:

- At what stage in the programme does Our Story want to be used?
- What would be the best method to use (assessment, baseline, monitoring, evaluation etc) to capture this information from the communities?
- What is the sampling method that would be most suitable for your Our Story initiative? This will affect location and community selection. 
- In order to ensure buy in and sustainability of Our Story, who are the stakeholders that should be involved  in the process, at the community, National Society, country, regional and global level?  It is recommended that the deployment team be kept small at the field level, in order to respect community space.
- How many days will be allocated for your initiative and what are the logistics on the ground which need to be planned?
The Our Story facilitation methods (photowalk, MSC, storycards) can be adapted depending upon what is to be measured in the project/programme. Using a participatory approach, Our Story works with the community from beginning to the end of the initiative. As it is a community-based initiative, it would be important to have the buy in from the community leader and the community before rolling out the Our Story process in the field.

## Configuration of Process

One example of the process that you can follow is given here: 

1. App Training 1 - providing a training for how to use basic features of joining a project, choosing a theme and capturing videos.. 
1. Capture - community are facilitated in their groups to capture footage
1. Review - groups then review and tag the footage they have captured and then capture more footage as required
1. Story Creation - they edit the footage into a single story making sure that each of the tags are represented in the final video 
1. Community Feedback - the final videos of each group is presented back to the wider community.

## Equipment

::: warning Before Entering The Field
You need to setup and install the Our Story application before entering the field!
:::

Although the Our Story infrastructure is flexible and can be used in many contexts, you will need a minimum amount of technology and materials to start a deployment.

Use the table below to determine which version of Our Story you will need to use and what you need to have as a minimum to run the deployment you need.
