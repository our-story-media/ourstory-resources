### Tutorial: Managing Stories

On the Shoot Manager, you can configure many details of the shoot and it's contents. You can also download stories and change the user that a story is assigned to. 

**Uploading Content: Requires WiFi connection to computer**

Uploading should be initiated when each device is connected to the WiFi and the application is running on the computer. In some cases, uploading a single device at a time may be faster than attempting to sync all simultaneously.

Depending on the participants, this upload process could be built into 'pitstops' during the filming process.

**Reviewing Content: Requires WiFi connection to computer**

Once content is uploaded from a device it is available to all participants to view and use in making stories.

::: tip WiFi / 3G Connection Required

This step in the process requires that the tablets have a connection to the Our Story Dashboard. With Titan this means making sure your local WiFi is turned on, and the Our Story Titan application is running.

**Requires WiFi connection to computer**

Multiple stories can be edited simultaneously, however processing of each is performed in a queue.

"**Publishing**" a story involves the application creating a single video file from the participants story.

Only one story is processed (published) at a time, so there may be a delay for participants waiting for their story to complete processing.

Our Story consumes lots of battery, particularly when performing story publishing. Keep an eye on your laptop battery and control power consumption where necessary.

Stories will continue to process without the Android device being available.

**Presenting Content**

Low resolution published content can be played directly from the Android devices that created the content, however you can open the upload directory located on the computer and play high quality versions directly.

**Using Content**

All content produced during the process is stored on the computer running the Our Story application.

These files are stored as mp4 video files in the ./upload folder. Lower resolution files are stored within the upload/transcode/upload folder.

**Trimming Videos **

1. To trim the beginning or end of a video, just click on the ‘Trim’ icon (Scissors), and drag the blue slider to the range of the video that you want to keep. As you adjust the sliders, the video will playback to reveal what the new video will look like. Once you are happy with the trim, just tap on the ‘Trim’ button again to exit trimming mode. 

2. It is not possible to make multiple trims within the same video so if you want to remove the middle of a video or if you want to use two small subsections of the video, then you should add the same video multiple times to the timeline and then edit each of those videos to reflect the desired changes.

*Tutorial: Enabling and Disabling the edit engine [Our Story: Titan]*

*This article is only applicable if you are using Our Story: Titan *

Due to the low bandwidth of the WiFi router that we use, and as we use laptops instead of high tech server infrastructure for the Our Story offline server, it is necessary to conserve resources. Editing and producing the final story files takes a lot of CPU power, hence we recommend that administrators disable the edit engine until all the groups has finished creating their stories. What happens otherwise is that if the edit engine is producing the story files for one group, other groups will be slowed down and not able to preview their videos to make their own stories. 

You can re-enable the edit engine at the end of the day, once you are sure that no more groups are working on their videos or at the end of the story creation stage for all the groups. 

As an administrator of the shoot, you can do this from the administrator page of the Our Story website. Make sure that  the ‘Process Edits’ checkbox is unchecked.
