Multiple stories can be edited simultaneously, however processing of each is performed in a queue.

"**Publishing**" a story involves the application creating a single video file from the participants story.

Only one story is processed (published) at a time, so there may be a delay for participants waiting for their story to complete processing.

Our Story consumes lots of battery, particularly when performing story publishing. Keep an eye on your laptop battery and control power consumption where necessary.

Stories will continue to process without the Android device being available.

**Presenting Content**

Low resolution published content can be played directly from the Android devices that created the content, however you can open the upload directory located on the computer and play high quality versions directly.

*Tutorial: Enabling and Disabling the edit engine [Our Story: Titan]*

*This article is only applicable if you are using Our Story: Titan *

Due to the low bandwidth of the WiFi router that we use, and as we use laptops instead of high tech server infrastructure for the Our Story offline server, it is necessary to conserve resources. Editing and producing the final story files takes a lot of CPU power, hence we recommend that administrators disable the edit engine until all the groups has finished creating their stories. What happens otherwise is that if the edit engine is producing the story files for one group, other groups will be slowed down and not able to preview their videos to make their own stories. 

You can re-enable the edit engine at the end of the day, once you are sure that no more groups are working on their videos or at the end of the story creation stage for all the groups. 

As an administrator of the shoot, you can do this from the administrator page of the Our Story website. Make sure that  the ‘Process Edits’ checkbox is unchecked.
