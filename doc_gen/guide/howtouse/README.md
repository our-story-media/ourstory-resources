# How to Use this Guide

<ClientOnly>

<Leader>

This guide is written so that you (a Facilitator within your organisation) can take the Indaba process and apply it to your context. We have made a few assumptions about the configuration of your context to make the guide easier to understand:

- We assume that you are part of an organisation/group wanting to capture video from a community with which you have direct access.
- We assume that you do not have professional video or production experience.
- We assume that you have a set of themes (criteria) to which you want the community to express their voice.

 Watch out for the following flyouts for more information:
