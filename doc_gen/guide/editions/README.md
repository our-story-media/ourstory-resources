Indaba and Indaba: Titan have been developed in association with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent. Both these variants contain features that are useful for International Development contexts, and are designed to be supported by a team of facilitators in the field.

*Indaba Titan* is a fully offline (standalone) application that runs on your Laptop. 

This is ideal for regions where there is no internet connectivity. To use this version, you will need a computer and a WiFi router. You will also need to install the [Titan Application](/quickstart/titan/) on the computer you take to the field. 

The mobile phones/tablets will be able to connect to this computer and we can deliver Indaba process, totally offline. A version developed for situations where no 3G or WiFi is available, this version can be deployed by facilitators on their own computer to provide the full Indaba workflow in remote or inaccessible locations.
