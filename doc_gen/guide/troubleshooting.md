## Android Application

### Connection Screen

The connection screen has a list of 4 checks that the app makes when starting up. These checks can help you diagnose potential issues with your Our Story setup.

- **WiFi Connected**: This checks if you have an active WiFi connection which the phone is connected to. If this is not ticked, check the device is connected to your local Our Story network.
- **IP Address Range Correct**: This checks if the network it is connected to is setup for Our Story, where it gets allocated an IP address in the range 10.10.10.x. If this is not ticked, check which WiFi is connected and check that this WiFi is the Our Story one.
- **Remote Application Found**: This checks that the Titan Dashboard computer can be found on the WiFi network. If this is not ticked, check your computer is on, connected to the Our Story WiFi and has configured it's IP address correctly.
- **Connection Established**: This checks that communication with the Dashboard is possible. If not ticked, check that the Dashboard application is running on your computer and restart if necessary.
