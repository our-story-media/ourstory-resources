# Using the Content

<Leader>

Community content can be captured for a variety of reasons. Most often the content needs to become available outside of the local context, and therefore requires transcription, translation and distribution, to maximise impact.

## Translation / Transcription

Our Story does not currently have a built in workflow for transcribing and translating content, however through our extensive use with partners we have developed a set of guiding principles which will help you make the most of your community content:

- **Only transcribe content that you will distribute:** This sounds simple, but dont waste resources getting content transcribed that will not be shared. Only transcribe the final stories produced by the communities.
- **Get transcription in the field:** Wherever possible, make sure to build in time with your partners in the field to transcribe content. Use trusted, well educated and informed people where possible, and at least try and leave the field with the transcription in a single language.


## Subtitling (Closed Captions)

**Working with people on the ground to enable good translations**

On this page, we present some guidelines for producing good subtitles that can then be loaded into the group stories so that they are accessible to a wider audience. 

## Open source software for subtitling videos

We recommend using YouTube Studio (studio.youtube.com) which has a good transcription feature. If your video is in the primary languages

Another option is Subtitle Edit, which is a free (open source) editor for video subtitles.

Once you are happy with the subtitle files you have produced, you can use Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro to burn the subtitle file to the final videos. In the future, we might add a feature to the Our Story server to have inbuilt subtitling features to enable this to be done within the workflow, but for now this is a limitation. 

Using Subtitle Edit, please load the final group story videos and create subtitles for everything spoken on screen. You can also use the help pages of Subtitle Edit to diagnose common issues:

Software for adding logos to videos 

Currently Our Story doesn't support the editing of the community published videos. If you want to add organisation logos, we suggest you use one of the many freely available tools (e.g. WIndows Movie Maker) to do this.
