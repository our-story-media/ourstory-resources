# Using the Content

<Leader>

Community content can be captured for a variety of reasons. Most often the content needs to become available outside of the local context, and therefore requires transcription, translation and distribution, to maximise impact.

## Tagged Stories

Stories can be exported from the Dashboard with the Tags `burned` onto the video. This is useful for sharing within your organisation and for reporting or monitoring. To change the language that the tags are `burnt` using, visit the `Settings` screen of the Dashboard before Publishing each story.

## Translation / Transcription

Our Story does not currently have a built in workflow for transcribing and translating content, however through our extensive use with partners we have developed a set of guiding principles which will help you make the most of your community content:

- **Only transcribe content that you will distribute:** This sounds simple, but dont waste resources getting content transcribed that will not be shared. Only transcribe the final stories produced by the communities.
- **Get transcription in the field:** Wherever possible, make sure to build in time with your partners in the field to transcribe content. Use trusted, well educated and informed people where possible, and at least try and leave the field with the transcription in a single language.

## Subtitling (Closed Captions)

Once transcription has been obtained in the appropriate language for your content, videos may need to be `burned` with Subtitles.




**Working with people on the ground to enable good translations**


## Open source software for subtitling videos

We recommend using YouTube Studio (studio.youtube.com) which has a good transcription feature. If your video is in the primary languages

Another option is Subtitle Edit, which is a free (open source) editor for video subtitles.

Once you are happy with the subtitle files you have produced, you can use Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro to burn the subtitle file to the final videos. In the future, we might add a feature to the Our Story server to have inbuilt subtitling features to enable this to be done within the workflow, but for now this is a limitation. 

Using Subtitle Edit, please load the final group story videos and create subtitles for everything spoken on screen. You can also use the help pages of Subtitle Edit to diagnose common issues:

Software for adding logos to videos 

Currently Our Story doesn't support the editing of the community published videos. If you want to add organisation logos, we suggest you use one of the many freely available tools (e.g. WIndows Movie Maker) to do this.
