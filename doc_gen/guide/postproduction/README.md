# Using the Content

<Leader>

Community content can be captured for a variety of reasons. Most often the content needs to become available outside of the local context, and therefore requires transcription, translation and distribution, to maximise impact.

</Leader>

<Tip title="Where Are My Videos?">

Remember that Indaba keeps a high-quality (HD) version of each story for download. From the Dashboard, locate the Story and select the `Download` or `Download (Tags)` option to get the final `.mp4` file.

</Tip>

## Tagged Stories

Stories can be exported from the Dashboard with the Tags `burned` onto the video. This is useful for sharing within your organisation and for reporting or monitoring. To change the language that the tags are `burnt` using, visit the `Settings` screen of the Dashboard before Publishing each story. Tags can also be enabled or disabled from appearing the final video (i.e. including DAC Criteria, but not `Introduction` and `Background` tags).

## Branding and Credits

Indaba automatically adds **credits** for any music used for a Story and a **title graphic** with a selected graphic (uploaded in the Dashboard) at the end of each Story. However if you want to add additional logos, credits or branding to your videos before releasing them you should use an off-the-shelf video editor. There are many easy to use editors available for free online and on mobile.

Examples include:

- Adobe Spark
- Adobe Rush
- Windows Movie Maker (Windows)
- iMovie (OSX)

## Translation and Transcription

Indaba has basic transcription and subtitling support as part of the Dashboard. See the guide around [Transcription](/guide/transcription). If you chose to use this feature in the field, published videos will include on-screen subtitles (captions).

<!-- Indaba does not currently have a built in workflow for transcribing and translating content, however  -->

Through our extensive use with partners we have developed a set of guiding principles which will help you make the most of your community content:

- **Only transcribe content that you will distribute:** This sounds simple, but don't waste resources getting content transcribed that will not be shared. Only transcribe the final stories produced by the communities.
- **Get transcription in the field:** Wherever possible, make sure to build in time with your partners in the field to transcribe content. Use trusted, well educated and informed people where possible, and at least try and leave the field with the transcription in a single language. If you use this tool, the subtitles will be `rendered` onto each story and you can provide these directly to the community.

If it is not possible to use the internal tool, you can also use one of the following:

Once transcription has been obtained in the appropriate language for your content, videos may need to be `burned` with Subtitles (Closed Captions). These are always visible on the video and cannot be hidden when playing it.

There are a number of options for doing this process depending on your scenario and personal preference:

**Option 1: YouTube Studio**

We recommend using YouTube Studio (studio.youtube.com) which has a good transcription feature. If your video is in one of the international languages supported by their platform, about 30 mins after uploading your content it will contain a 'good guess' transcription of your video which you can adjust using their online editor.

**Option 2: Subtitle Edit Software**

If you cannot distribute your content via YouTube, another option is Subtitle Edit, which is a free (open source) editor for video subtitles.

Once you are happy with the subtitle files you have produced, you can use a video editor such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro to `burn` the subtitle file to the final videos.

Using Subtitle Edit, load the final group story videos and create subtitles for everything spoken on screen. You can also use the help pages of Subtitle Edit to diagnose common issues:
